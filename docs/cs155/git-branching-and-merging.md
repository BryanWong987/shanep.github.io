# Branching and Merging

This module will introduce two powerful concepts, branching and merging.
Git provides a solid set of commands that allows developers to work on
several different versions of the code at once. These distinct versions
are called branches. Branches may consist of a new feature, a bug that
you need to isolate, or numerous other reasons to create a separate
branch of code. We will leverage Gitâ€™s fantastic branching and merging
features in this module.
